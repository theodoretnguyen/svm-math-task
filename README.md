# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Math Task

# Background

This notebook was created during my time at [Yonsei International Summer School](https://summer.yonsei.ac.kr/home/), where I took an Introduction to Machine Learning course taught by [Professor Woong Lim](https://sites.google.com/view/woong-lim/home).

# Goal

The goal of this notebook is to dig deeper into the math and concept behind linear support vector machines (linear SVM).

A lot of my fellow classmates came from non-technical backgrounds, so the topic of linear support vector machines puzzled many of them. With my background in mathematics, teaching, and Python programming, I crafted this notebook in order to assist my classmates' understanding of this machine learning model. This notebook was written with the voice, format, notation, and explanation style that is intended to be approachable, clear, and engaging.

*Note: The `data_points.csv` file is an alternative option for inputting data. Originally, the notebook reads in data via user input.*
